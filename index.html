       <p>
            Hello, my name is Carlos Cordero and I am currently enrolled in the Year Up program in the Quality Assurance track.
            Year Up's  goal is to "Close the Opportunity Divide." It is an intensive, competitive technical training and career development program with over 250 corporate partners, graduating about 4,000 students annually across 19 cities. 
            The program includes college-level courses, professional training, and a six-month internship. 
 
            I am currently undergoing a career change and want to get into the tech industry. I have always been fascinated with how computers work. 
            I learned different programs by going into them and starting to play around with them. 
            Growing up, I was the Director of Sound and Visuals for my church for about 5 years. 
            Each year, I would manage a different team of about 5 people. I am a hardworking, disciplined, and a non-conformist. 
            I would like to work at a top tech company whose ideals match mine and make my way towards becoming a software developer.
       </p>
       <p>
            Before joining Year Up, I worked for the Washington State Patrol working my ways toward becoming a Trooper. 
            During my time there, I learned about attention to detail, about punctuality, and about integrity. 
            I put to use my critical thinking and problem solving skills on a daily basis. 
            I was able to develop my observation skills, my decision making skills, and my conflict resolution skills, but above all I learned to be a leader. 
            And I believe that a professional is a leader. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            I have always enjoyed anything related to technology. 
            I'm "Tech Savvy." In school I took courses like graphic design and photography. 
            I remember I would spend countless hours learning how to use the Adobe Suite. I learned Photoshop, Illustrator and Premier Pro. 
            I also learned the Microsoft Office Suite. During my time learning, I developed my typing proficiency as well. 
            When I think of a "Professional" I think about athletes that have mastered their craft. 
            During the past few months and for the near future, Year Up has and will continue to help me master my craft. 
            I am in the process of learning to code, learning data analysis, learning about different coding languages. 
            All these different tasks will help me master my craft and continue to strive for professionalism. 
       </p>
